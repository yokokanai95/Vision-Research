VISION-RESEARCH-CODE

This is code from a project that I am currently working on as part of my 
research assistantship at the Vanderbilt Vision Research Center. In it, I am 
employing Psychtoolbox for MATLAB to create a game-like experiment that explores
visual cognition, attentional blink, and binocular rivalry to explore the 
effects of attention on bistable perception. The experiment employs the use of 
a mirror stereoscope in order to present contrasting visual information to 
either eye, and records response time and accuracy from the subject.
