VISION-RESEARCH-CODE

This is code from a few projects that I worked on as part of my junior year
research assistantship at the Vanderbilt Vision Research Center. In it, I am 
employing Psychtoolbox for MATLAB to create a game-like experiments that explore
visual cognition, attentional blink, and binocular rivalry to examine the 
effects of attention on bistable perception. The experiments employs the use of 
a mirror stereoscope in order to present contrasting visual information to 
each eye, and records response time and accuracy from the subject.
